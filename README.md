# Express-Note-Taker

## Description

<p>This project was created to create an application for Note taker that can be used to write and save notes. It contains notes on HTML, CSS and express.js.</p>
<p>I created a Note taker with using the express mobule in npm package that meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>This app runs in the terminal and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by express.js code.</p>
<p>I learned how to get data from data base and post data to data base, save the requested data into data base and deploy the entire application to Heroku.</p>
<p>Also I learned how to synchronize between front-end and back-end with express.js</p><br>
